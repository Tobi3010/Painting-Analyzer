# Painting Analyzer 

Artists are inspired by other artists' work, leading them to study how the artworks of others are structured. This project aims to help this process, by letting a user upload images, and enable different filters, to show the fundamental building blocks of the artworks, such as:

- Value, the lightness and darkness of colors. Options:
    - Basic grayscale, all values between black to white.
    - Binary, pure black and white conversion.
    - Selecting of number of shades, convert image to that number of gray shades.
- Perspective, the illusion of depth:
    - Detect and draw vanishing lines, vanishing points, and horizon line.
    - Identify and work on multiple perspective types: 1-point, 2-point, 3-point, fishe-eye, isometric.
- Composition rules, the arrangement of elements in art:
    - Identify, if any, composition rules used in the art piece: rule of thirds, golden spiral, diagonal, and such.
    - Draw lines to show how the art work aligns with the composition rule.
- Color scheme, the combination of colors used:
    - Show the colors of the artwork on the colorwheel.
    - Detect groups of colors, and colorschemes: monocromatic, analogous, complimentary, and so.
    - Highlight where each group of color is used.
- Brush detection(digital art):
    - Identify the brush types used in the artwork, and display them to the user.
- (maybe) Contrast, detect differrent types of contrasts, such as: color, value, texture, detail.
- (maybe) Edge types: detect hard, soft and blury edges.
